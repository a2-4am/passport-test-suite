Reading from S6,D1                      
T00,S00 Found Pascal bootloader         
T00,S0B Volume name is SYSMAS           
Using built-in RWTS                     
Writing to S6,D2                        
                                        
The disk was copied successfully, but   
Passport did not apply any patches.     
                                        
Possible reasons:                       
- The source disk is not copy protected.
- The target disk works without patches.
- The disk uses an unknown protection,  
  and Passport can not help any further.
