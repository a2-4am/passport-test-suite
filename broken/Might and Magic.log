Reading from S6,D1                      
T00,S00 Found DOS 3.3 bootloader        
Using disk's own RWTS                   
Writing to S6,D2                        
T0D is unformatted                      
                                        
The disk was copied successfully, but   
Passport did not apply any patches.     
                                        
Possible reasons:                       
- The source disk is not copy protected.
- The target disk works without patches.
- The disk uses an unknown protection,  
  and Passport can not help any further.
